814d6b,summarize how the third wave developed over such a short period of time and why the experiment was ended,the third wave,"background the third wave experiment took place at cubberley high school in palo alto california during the first week of april one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven history teacher ron jones finding himself unable to explain to his students how people throughout history followed the crowd even when terrible things were happening decided to demonstrate it to his students through an experiment jones announced that he was starting a movement aimed to eliminate democracy jones named the movement “the third wave” as a symbol of strength referring to the mythical belief that the third in a series of waves is the strongest one of the central points of this movement was that democracy’s main weakness is that it favors the individual over the whole community jones emphasized this main point of the movement when he created this catchy motto “strength through discipline strength through community strength through action strength through pride” the experiment jones started the first day of the experiment emphasizing simple things like proper seating and drilled the students extensively until they got it right he then proceeded to enforce strict classroom discipline by emerging as an authoritarian figure this resulted in dramatic improvements to the efficiency or orderliness of the class the first day’s session ended with only a few rules jones intended it to be a oneday experiment students had to be sitting at attention before the second bell had to stand up to ask or answer questions and had to do it in three words or fewer and were required to preface each remark with “mr jones” as the week went on jones’ class transformed into a group with a supreme sense of discipline and community jones made up a salute resembling that of the nazi regime and ordered class members to salute each other even outside the class they all obeyed this command after only three days the experiment took on a life of its own with students from all over the school joining in the class expanded from initial thirty students to forty-three attendees all of the students showed drastic improvement in their academic skills and tremendous motivation all of the students were issued a member card and each of them received a special assignment like designing a third wave banner stopping nonmembers from entering the class or other tasks to bring honor to the movement jones instructed the students on how to initiate new members and by the end of the day the movement had over two hundred participants jones was surprised that some of the students started reporting to him when other members of the movement failed to abide by the rules by the fourth day of the experiment the students became increasingly involved in the project and their discipline and loyalty to the project was so outstanding that jones felt it was slipping out of control he decided to terminate the movement so he lied to students by announcing that the third wave was a part of a nationwide movement and that on the next day a presidential candidate of the movement would publicly announce its existence on television jones ordered students to attend a noon rally on friday to witness the announcement at the end of the week instead of a televised address of their leader the students were presented with a blank channel after a few minutes of waiting jones announced that they had been a part of an experiment to demonstrate how people willingly create a sense of superiority over others and how this can lead people to justify doing horrible things in the name of the state’s honor","background the third wave experiment took place at cubberley high school in

ebad26,summarize the various ways the factory would use or cover up spoiled meat cite evidence in your answer,excerpt from the jungle,with one member trimming beef in a cannery and another working in a sausage factory the family had a firsthand knowledge of the great majority of packingtown swindles for it was the custom as they found whenever meat was so spoiled that it could not be used for anything else either to can it or else to chop it up into sausage with what had been told them by jonas who had worked in the pickle rooms they could now study the whole of the spoiledmeat industry on the inside and read a new and grim meaning into that old packingtown jest—that they use everything of the pig except the squeal jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell and sell it to be eaten on freelunch counters also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed giving to any sort of meat fresh or salted whole or chopped any color and any flavor and any odor they chose in the pickling of hams they had an ingenious apparatus by which they saved time and increased the capacity of the plant—a machine consisting of a hollow needle attached to a pump by plunging this needle into the meat and working with his foot a man could fill a ham with pickle in a few seconds and yet in spite of this there would be hams found spoiled some of them with an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them to pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle which destroyed the odor—a process known to the workers as “giving them thirty per cent” also after the hams had been smoked there would be found some that had gone to the bad formerly these had been sold as “number three grade” but later on some ingenious person had hit upon a new device and now they would extract the bone about which the bad part generally lay and insert in the hole a whitehot iron after this invention there was no longer number one two and three grade—there was only number one grade the packers were always originating such schemes—they had what they called “boneless hams” which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings and “california hams” which were the shoulders with big knuckle joints and nearly all the meat cut out and fancy “skinned hams” which were made of the oldest hogs whose skins were so heavy and coarse that no one would buy them—that is until they had been cooked and chopped fine and labeled “head cheese” it was only when the whole ham was spoiled that it came into the department of elzbieta cut up by the twothousandrevolutions aminute flyers and mixed with half a ton of other meat no odor that ever was in a ham could make any difference there was never the least attention paid to what was cut up for sausage there would come all the way back from europe old sausage that had been rejected and that was moldy and white – it would be dosed with borax and glycerin and dumped into the hoppers and made over again for home consumption there would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor in the dirt and sawdust where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs there would be meat stored in great piles in rooms and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it and thousands of rats would race about on it it was too dark in these storage places to see well but a man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats these rats were nuisances and the packers would put poisoned bread out for them they would die and then rats bread and meat would go into the hoppers together this is no fairy story and no joke the meat would be shoveled into carts and the man who did the shoveling would not trouble to lift out a rat even when he saw one – there were things that went into the sausage in comparison with which a poisoned rat was a tidbit there was no place for the men to wash their hands before they ate their dinner and so they made a practice of washing them in the water that was to be ladled into the sausage there were the buttends of smoked meat and the scraps of corned beef and all the odds and ends of the waste of the plants that would be dumped into old barrels in the cellar and left there under the system of rigid economy which the packers enforced there were some jobs that it only paid to do once in a long time and among these was the cleaning out of the waste barrels every spring they did it and in the barrels would be dirt and rust and old nails and stale water – and cartload after cartload of it would be taken up and dumped into the hoppers with fresh meat and sent out to the publics breakfast some of it they would make into smoked sausage – but as the smoking took time and was therefore expensive they would call upon their chemistry department and preserve it with borax and color it with gelatin to make it brown all of their sausage came out of the same bowl but when they came to wrap it they would stamp some of it special and for this they would charge two cents more a pound,with one
